                    are the best ones, as they are not too early or too late. The ideal
                    time for starting preparation if you haven’t studied during
                    sessional exams is one month. If you’ve studied just appropriate
                    before then it is 14 days.

                    early before actual submission time. Do it on your own if you think it will
                    prepare you in any way in your future or just copy it. Help your friends by
                    providing them completed assignments this will create a state of mutual
                    symbiosis and thus helping you too.

                <ol>
                    <li>Puppets of teacher’s hand.</li>
                    <li>Those who mingles.</li>
                    <li>Lone wolves.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    <span>Master Gp Said: </span>It is seen that students who lick their
                    teacher’s toes (Rubbing board, always sitting in first three rows,
                    helping teachers without being asked for help) might succeed early
                    or with little efforts but it eventually weakens their qualities of
                    self-reliance and confidence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The type two persona is best as you are doing what is just needed.
                    These students follow the commands of their teachers. Never
                    disappoint them, never argues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Worst are the lone wolves, who for their self-pride or esteem argue
                    with them and got less attention thereafter. The relationship ends
                    with a pitiful state of securing less than 50% internal marks. It
                    can be avoided by following the second point.

                    <span>Master Gp Said: </span>It depends person to person, some
                    students are good at understanding and retaining theories while
                    others are competent in solving logic based or numerical problems.
                    Find your type in first semester and remember that what remains
                    beyond your type is what you have to struggle with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Generally, engineering is easy for students who are expert of type
                    2, but theoretical subjects too have long been known as hurdles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Type 3 is comical, they are easy most of the times, not helpful in
                    future in any way. So, avoid in-depth preparation of these subjects
                    and focus on previous years papers..

                    <span>Master Gp Said: </span>Fearful are those who prepare one night
                    before exam, Calm and focused are those who studied appropriately,
                    Fearless are those who have nothing to study (that they’ve revised
                    thrice). The second approach is rewarding in academic as well future
                    career.

                <p>
                    <span>Master Gp Said: </span>Approach 2 is best as 40 sheets are
                    actually more than enough, it is seen that students who write
                    letters of bumble bee size can take supplementary. More than 25
                    pages are just appropriate if they are well written (covered in next
                    case). But never try the third approach.

                        Always start the longest section first, it will help you to secure

                    <li>
                        Try to attempt each and every question, no matter what, chances of
                        a good examiner is 50%.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tell your buddies to cheat only after you’ve done, else you’ll
                        miss your own paper.

                    <span>Master Gp Said: </span>: First type of examiners may sound fictional, but they
                    actually exist, and it is a matter of pure luck. The other two types are
                    found frequently, the best way is to follow the “ten semester exam skills”
                    and “Study when required approach”.

                <ol class="golden">
                    <li>College is the most rewarding period of life, understand it
                        thoroughly.</li>
                    <li>RTU is there to provide you degree.</li>
                    <li>RTU is there to rip off your clothes if you’ll not going to understand
                        its way of working.</li>
                    <li>The prime objective should be No Back mindset with 60%
                        aggregate.</li>
                    <li>This system comprises of Teachers, students and you, understand
                        the three and exceed uninterruptedly.
                    </li>
                    <li>. Always pursue a chill mindset. No matter what!.</li>
                    <li>
                        Stop impressing others, else your own destiny breaks up with you.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Never argue with bullies (teachers), they are in oblivion YOU are
                        not entitled for that.
                    </li>
                    <li>A good citizen never says cuss words about his country, similar is
                        your alma mater.</li>
                    <li>Enjoy each and everything.</li>

                    <span>Master Gp: [Coughs] [Coughs heavily][After taking a sip of matcha]</span>That’s good. I have
                    seen time flying, hearts broken, tears turned into
                    pearls, bad times pervading, health declining, but after all these
                    nuisances the most important thing that remains in the mind of
                    graduates is “The best days of my life are gone now”. An undergraduate
                    can’t understand this but he might understand the best days from his
                    school time, a school kid might favor his Kinder Garden period and so on.
                    This leaves a good learning for us, it is “Each day is wonderful, we
                    understand it only when it is gone”. So, the first lesson is “enjoy each
                    day”.
